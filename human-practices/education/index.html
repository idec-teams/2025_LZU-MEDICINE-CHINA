<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Numerous instances show that obtaining a quality education plays a vital role in building a brighter future. This holds true not just for individuals, but also for countries and communities alike. Our alma mater, Lanzhou University, is located in northwestern China—a region marked by a relatively sparse landscape and economic growth that lags far behind more prosperous areas like Shanghai or Guangdong. Furthermore, its inland location leads to insufficient transportation choices. All these elements combine to result in a less-than-ideal state of educational advancement in this area.</p>
<p>Amid globalization, coastal areas are thriving, whereas our inland region seems to face a grim prospect. It appears our university has little chance of regaining its position as one of China's top ten universities. Our current situation and the resources we can access are similar to those of people living in other inland regions and nations. In a global context driven by maritime commerce, individuals in inland areas struggle to obtain the same resources as their coastal counterparts across multiple fields, including economy, trade, technology, and education.</p>
<p>One pivotal night, along the quiet paths of our educational journey, a discussion took place that would change the trajectory of our lives:</p>
<p>“Compared to people from coastal areas, do those in inland regions face an inherent obstacle when it comes to education?” a team member pondered, his tone tinged with frustration. “As inland residents, does having fewer resources make it more difficult for us to achieve success?”</p>
<p>Another team member responded, “Maybe we don’t always have to pursue the highest accolades. Through diligence, we can become our own role models, forge our distinct identities, and set an example in our region. Although we may not be able to help more people gain access to high-quality educational resources, developing a comprehensive set of educational activities that target the broadest possible audience is already a meaningful contribution!”</p>
<p>Thus, we made the decision to embark on an extensive science popularization initiative. We hold the view that the spread of scientific knowledge should be inclusive—catering to all age groups and reaching the largest number of people possible.</p>
<p>Our initiative covers four distinct levels: schools, communities and cities, the nation, and the world. Each level presents its own unique challenges and opportunities. At the school level, we focused on two specific age groups: young children (including elementary school students) and university students.</p>
<p><img alt="picture_1" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/education2/57.webp" /></p>
<p><strong>In schools</strong>, we held engaging science games for kids, arranged laboratory visits, organized scientific conferences for university students, and hosted slide painting events. These efforts sparked children’s interest and encouraged them to express complex scientific ideas through artistic means.</p>
<p><strong>In Lanzhou, Gansu Province</strong>, we teamed up with community service centers and hospitals to deliver science popularization activities open to people of all ages. These events mainly included interactive games and informative lectures to make science accessible and enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>On a national scale</strong>, we designed targeted educational programs to address regional gaps in resources. We also distributed printed handbooks on gut health knowledge to locations across the country, ensuring valuable health-related scientific knowledge reached more people.</p>
<p><strong>Globally</strong>, we developed and spread multilingual handbooks on gut health knowledge, shared science articles via WeChat official accounts, and created a guide advocating for educational equity. We are dedicated to removing all barriers to the spread of scientific knowledge—whether those barriers are related to national borders, natural conditions, age, or gender.</p>
<p>By adopting a precision-focused strategy, we have guaranteed that <strong>everyone—no matter their age, ethnicity, gender, or background—can access scientific knowledge</strong>. We successfully merged art and science, carrying out educational activities in lively, engaging ways that bring people together globally in spirit and purpose.</p>
<h1 id="our-view-of-education">Our view of education</h1>
<p>From our team’s perspective, education has been invested with far deeper, more abundant meaning—it extends well beyond simple knowledge indoctrination and skill instruction, evolving into a profound spiritual journey and a transformative feast of wisdom awakening. We firmly hold that the true essence of education, as articulated by French Enlightenment thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau, goes beyond merely sowing knowledge seeds in students’ hearts; it also kindles the inner fire that drives them to explore the unknown and pursue truth, guiding them onto an extraordinary path of self-discovery and growth.</p>
<p>The ancient Chinese sage Laozi once stated, “Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.” As a group of explorers fueled by scientific aspirations and a passion for education, we are dedicated to creating an open, inclusive, and innovative learning space. Here, every student can thrive freely on this fertile ground of knowledge and dare to push boundaries in their exploration. We believe the power of education lies in unlocking students’ inherent learning potential. Through a project-based learning approach, we encourage students to think independently, engage in hands-on practice, and connect theoretical knowledge with real-world problems. This way, they deepen their understanding through experience, strengthen their resolve amid challenges, and learn to communicate and collaborate effectively in teamwork.</p>
<p>On the iDEC platform, we urge students to dare to question and challenge authority. We also guide every member to pay attention to social hot topics, reflect on science and technology ethics, view the world through a scientific lens, and touch people’s hearts with humanistic compassion. In various community initiatives, we put our acquired knowledge into practice to assist others—this not only supports community residents but also serves as a valuable learning experience for every team member. Because we place great emphasis on spiritual connection and enlightenment, our ultimate goal in education is to nurture future leaders who possess independent thinking abilities, a strong sense of social responsibility, and genuine humanistic care. We are convinced that such education can cultivate interdisciplinary talents with both profound scientific literacy and noble moral character, thereby contributing to societal progress and development.</p>
<p>In summary, the iDEC team’s educational philosophy and mission center on prioritizing the enlightenment of the mind and the awakening of wisdom alongside imparting knowledge. By leveraging innovative educational methods, we stir up students’ intrinsic drive, equipping them to become young people of the new era—individuals with an innovative spirit, practical skills, a sense of social responsibility, and humanistic empathy. We firmly believe this is education in its truest form: one that not only illuminates students’ futures but also lights the path for the advancement of human civilization.</p>

<p>"Using technology to safeguard health and taking action to serve people's wellbeing" is the core philosophy of LZU-MEDICINE-CHINA. They are well aware that, as future researchers, they have the responsibility and obligation to integrate their knowledge with social practice and contribute to improving public health. Wulipu Community, where the event was held, became an ideal partner thanks to its harmonious community atmosphere and the residents' eagerness to learn about health.</p>
<p>When the event started, team members gave opening remarks, and then clarified to the community residents the importance of perioperative gut health and the significance of this event. The team members delivered a clear and accessible explanation on the functions of gut microbiota, common causes of perioperative gut microbiota dysbiosis (such as antibiotic use, anesthesia, and surgical stress), its clinical manifestations, and its impact on postoperative recovery. They especially emphasized the key role of a balanced diet, the use of microecological preparations, and pre- and postoperative nutritional support in regulating gut microbiota.</p>
<p><img alt="picture_48" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/education2/47.webp" /></p>
<p>During the lecture, community residents listened with great interest and took the initiative to raise their hands to ask questions from time to time, making the on-site interaction very active. In response to everyone’s enthusiastic participation, members of LZU-MEDICINE-CHINA remained patient and meticulous throughout, answering each question in detail—whether it was the residents’ concern about "how to adjust diet to maintain the stability of gut microbiota," their confusion about "which postoperative care details can help restore gut microbiota," or their eager attention to the conditioning technologies related to perioperative gut microbiota dysbiosis, the team members all provided clear and organized responses based on their solid professional knowledge reserve. Their professionalism and attentiveness won unanimous trust and praise from the residents.</p>

<p>In the activity room of Luoyu New Village Community, Tianshui City, Gansu Province, a "Little Guardians of Gut Health" themed activity—tailored specifically for children—was unfolding warmly in a child-friendly, playful way.</p>
<p>Initiated by LZU-MEDICINE-CHINA, this health promotion activity was more than just a transfer of knowledge; it was a warm interaction that used fun to bridge the gap between science and children. The team members brought carefully prepared sports props and colorful popular science picture books, turning "gut health" into an enjoyable experience that the children could understand, engage with, and remember.</p>
<p>The activity aimed to enhance children’s awareness of gut health management by combining scientific exercise with health knowledge lectures, thereby laying a solid foundation for potential postoperative recovery in the future.</p>
<p><img alt="picture_48" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/education2/48.webp" /></p>
<p>During the activity, children played games amid laughter and cheers. They also crowded around the team members, holding promotional pamphlets and asking eagerly: “If I jump rope every day from now on, will the ‘good bacteria’ all like me?” The team members responded patiently and carefully explained to the children ways to maintain gut health.</p>
<p>Many parents expressed that they hoped more such activities would be held—not only do they allow children to learn health knowledge through play, but they also provide parents with practical care guidelines.</p>
<p><img alt="picture_49" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/education2/49.webp" /></p>
<p><img alt="picture_50" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/education2/50.webp" /></p>
<p>For LZU-MEDICINE-CHINA, this community-based children’s gut health activity is not only a "practical application" of professional knowledge, but also a vivid interpretation of the concept of "technology serving the people." The team members deeply realized that when facing children, professional knowledge needs to be hidden in fun and integrated into interactions; furthermore, protecting children's perioperative health requires the joint efforts of families, communities, and society.</p>
<p>Additionally, this activity highlights the warmth of iDEC education—while fostering research capabilities, it guides young people to convey science in ways accessible to children and practice care for life through actions, allowing the seeds of "health" to take root and germinate quietly in the depths of children's hearts.</p>

<h2 id="street-survey-and-advocacy-on-perioperative-gut-health-knowledge">Street Survey and Advocacy on Perioperative Gut Health Knowledge</h2>
<p>At first, we conducted street interviews, invited passers-by to fill out questionnaires, and gathered information on the public's understanding of perioperative gut health issues.</p>
<p><img alt="picture_51" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/education2/51.webp" /></p>
<p>However, through these interviews, we found that the general public’s awareness of perioperative gut health issues remains very limited—many people are not even aware of its importance. Therefore, we designed and produced simple promotional posters and brochures. While providing the public with information related to gut health, we also urged more people to pay attention to their own gut health.</p>
<p><img alt="picture_52" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/education2/3.webp" /></p>
