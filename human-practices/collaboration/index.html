<h1 id="1-overview-of-collaboration">1. Overview of Collaboration</h1>
<p>Throughout the iDEC journey, we have had the privilege of collaborating
with multiple teams, academic institutions, organizations, companies,
and local communities, enriching our project, fostering knowledge
exchange, and advancing the cause of global scientific development.</p>
<p><img alt="picture_1" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/collabroation/1.webp" /></p>
<p>Throughout our project journey, the team fully mobilized both internal
and external resources, deeply engaged with multiple stakeholders within
the campus and society, and established a dual-driven model of \'campus
collaboration and empowerment + practical implementation beyond
campus.\' With synthetic biology technology at the core, we have strived
to fulfill our commitment to improving public health and advancing
medical development.</p>
<p>Within the campus, the team has integrated resources through
multi-dimensional cooperation: the team has formed a \"popular science
promotion group+school-local cooperation group+technology transformation
group\" in conjunction with eight student associations to carry out high
school and middle school roving lectures, cross-school academic research
and technology popularization dismantling, covering more than 2,000
teachers and students. Relying on the four colleges of Lanzhou
University to hold a series of activities of \"Frontier of Intestinal
Microflora and Synthetic Biology\", combining academic lectures,
experimental workshops and knowledge competition, the transfer of
professional knowledge and discipline practice credit incentive was
achieved. We deepen cooperation with school management departments,
upgrade from \"special grants\" to \"systematic empowerment\", obtain
grants for iDEC competitions, international academic docking and brand
promotion support for scientific innovation, and lay a solid foundation
for project development. At the same time, we actively expanded
inter-school cooperation, carried out thematic exchanges with iDEC teams
from more than 10 universities such as Tianjin University and Jilin
University, participated in the CCIC Conference, the Peking University
Symposium on \"Living Drug Engineering\", and others.</p>
<p>Outside the campus, the team extensively connected with social
resources: collaborating with organizations such as the Gansu Health
Management Association and the Red Cross Society of Gansu Province, we
engaged with communities to conduct fun science outreach activities like
the \'Gut Bacteria Exploration Experiment\' and \'Probiotic DIY
Models,\' while distributing the \'Perioperative Gut Care Handbook.\' We
also conducted project-related research in close partnership with
medical staff from Lanzhou University First Hospital and Lanzhou
University Second Hospital. Additionally, through a collaboration with
Jinghong Health Company, we received guidance on business planning and
explored the potential for functional food development. By working with
the Gansu Provincial CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention),
we optimized the project's application scenarios based on regional
epidemiological data and explored potential collaborations in public
health decision-making.</p>
<h1 id="2-internal-cooperation-and-resource-integration-within-the-campus">2. Internal Cooperation and Resource Integration within the Campus</h1>
<h2 id="21-student-organizations-three-dimensional-structure-to-promote-knowledge-transfer-and-practice">2.1 Student Organizations: Three-dimensional Structure to Promote Knowledge Transfer and Practice</h2>
<p>Around the theme of \"intestinal flora and perioperative health\", we
created the three-dimensional organizational structure of \"popular
science promotion group+school-land cooperation group+technology
transformation group\", to promote the social transmission of synthetic
biology knowledge and project value.</p>
<p>Popular science promotion group: develop \"intestinal bacteria: friend
or enemy?\" The two sets of theme PPTs of \"What Happens to the
Perioperative Microflora\" jointly organized eight student associations
in the school (such as the Biological Science Association and the
Medical Science Popularization Society) and the school\'s official
education team to carry out a lecture tour in local colleges and high
schools in Gansu Province. The posters\' professional contents such as
\"intestinal probiotic function\" and \"flora disorder mechanism during
the perioperative period\" were presented in a popular way, covering
more than 2,000 teachers and students.</p>
<p><img alt="picture_2" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/collabroation/2.webp" /></p>
<p>School-location collaboration group: academic partnerships were
established with other medical colleges and universities to jointly
carry out the cross-school research on \"perioperative intestinal
health\". At the same time, popular science activities on \"intestinal
flora and health\" were conducted for the elderly and postoperative
patients in a number of hospitals in Lanzhou (including the
Gastrointestinal Surgery Department of the First Lanzhou University
Hospital) and community health service centers, and the \"Perioperative
Intestinal Care Handbook\" designed based on project posters was
distributed in response to the community\'s demand for postoperative
health management.</p>
<p><img alt="picture_3" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/collabroation/3.webp" /></p>
<p><img alt="picture_4" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/collabroation/4.webp" /></p>
<p>Technology transformation group: linked with the internal
entrepreneurship community and medical innovation organization, the
technical logic of the project \"transforming lactobacillus casei into
oleic acid\" was disassembled into public science modules such as \"How
does probiotics work accurately?\" , explore the social understandable
path of synthetic biological therapy, enhance the public awareness of
the technology.</p>
<p><img alt="picture_5" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/collabroation/5.webp" /></p>
<p>In addition, through the student organization network, we have
established a long-term collaborative network of \"university student
organizations+medical institutions+communities\". For example, we have
reached a cooperation with a community health service station in Lanzhou
City, and plan to include \"intestinal flora science popularization\" in
its regular activities, so that the practical results can continuously
serve the improvement of public health awareness.</p>
<h2 id="22-academic-departments-leading-edge-academic-activities-jointly-carried-out-by-multiple-colleges">2.2 Academic Departments: Leading-edge Academic Activities Jointly Carried Out by Multiple Colleges</h2>
<p>We received support from the First Clinical Medical College, the School
of Stomatology, the School of Life Sciences, and the School of Basic
Medicine at Lanzhou University. These colleges jointly organized the
\'Lanzhou University Campus Science Outreach Exhibition and Laboratory
Equipment Drawing Competition,\' a series of campus events with us. The
event was mainly divided into three sub-activities: 1.Synthetic biology
and the LZU-MEDICINE-CHINA team project promotion; 2.Laboratory
equipment drawing competition, featuring items such as microscope
slides; 3.Interesting science experiments, where students not only
gained an in-depth understanding of professional content like
\'intestinal probiotics functions\' and \'engineered bacteria design
logic\' from the posters but also had the chance to win research-related
prizes through academic interaction and earn academic practice credits
(or activity points).</p>
<p>During the event, expert teams from various colleges provided
full-process guidance, from scientific content validation to academic
format design. For example, a professor from the Department of
Gastrointestinal Surgery at the Medical College personally explained the
\'clinical significance of microbiome disruption during the
perioperative period.\' The Synthetic Biology Laboratory from the School
of Life Sciences conducted a \'genetically engineered bacteria
construction\' simulation experiment, and professors from the School of
Basic Medicine led students in fun scientific experiments. Through these

<h2 id="23-school-management-from-special-funding-to-systematic-empowerment">2.3 School Management: From Special Funding to Systematic Empowerment</h2>
<p>We have continuously deepened our cooperation with the university's
administrative departments. Building on the foundation of past inclusion
in the university\'s support system, we have already received approval
for a university-level project this year. We further promoted the
upgrade of resource support from the International Affairs Office and
the Research Management Department, achieving a shift from \'specialized
funding\' to \'systematic empowerment.\' Not only did we receive
additional funding for participation in the iDEC international
competition and global promotion of our results, but we also gained deep
collaboration from the administrative departments in areas like
international academic cooperation and university-level science and
innovation branding.</p>
<p>Through the continued output of the \'Gut Microbiome Engineering
Bacteria\' project's milestones (such as laboratory data and the impact
of science outreach), we demonstrated the long-term value of the iDEC
team, which led the university's administrative departments to shift
from \'initial support\' to \'ongoing investment.\' This further
solidified the iDEC project's position in the university's international
science and innovation strategy, while also establishing a strong
administrative resource foundation for the team's future international
exchanges and results transformation.</p>
