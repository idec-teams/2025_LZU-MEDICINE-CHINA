This holds true not just for individuals, but also for countries and communities alike. Our alma mater, Lanzhou University, is located in northwestern China\u2014a region marked by a relatively sparse landscape and economic growth that lags far behind more prosperous areas like Shanghai or Guangdong. Furthermore, its inland location leads to insufficient transportation choices. All these elements combine to result in a less-than-ideal state of educational advancement in this area.</p> <p>Amid globalization, coastal areas are thriving, whereas our inland region seems to face a grim prospect. It appears our university has little chance of regaining its position as one of China's top ten universities. Our current situation and the resources we can access are similar to those of people living in other inland regions and nations. In a global context driven by maritime commerce, individuals in inland areas struggle to obtain the same resources as their coastal counterparts across multiple fields, including economy, trade, technology, and education.</p> <p>One pivotal night, along the quiet paths of our educational journey, a discussion took place that would change the trajectory of our lives:</p> <p>\u201cCompared to people from coastal areas, do those in inland regions face an inherent obstacle when it comes to education?\u201d a team member pondered, his tone tinged with frustration. \u201cAs inland residents, does having fewer resources make it more difficult for us to achieve success?\u201d</p> <p>Another team member responded, \u201cMaybe we don\u2019t always have to pursue the highest accolades. Through diligence, we can become our own role models, forge our distinct identities, and set an example in our region. Although we may not be able to help more people gain access to high-quality educational resources, developing a comprehensive set of educational activities that target the broadest possible audience is already a meaningful contribution!\u201d</p> <p>Thus, we made the decision to embark on an extensive science popularization initiative. We hold the view that the spread of scientific knowledge should be inclusive\u2014catering to all age groups and reaching the largest number of people possible.</p> <p>Our initiative covers four distinct levels: schools, communities and cities, the nation, and the world. Each level presents its own unique challenges and opportunities. At the school level, we focused on two specific age groups: young children (including elementary school students) and university students.</p> <p></p> <p>In schools, we held engaging science games for kids, arranged laboratory visits, organized scientific conferences for university students, and hosted slide painting events. These efforts sparked children\u2019s interest and encouraged them to express complex scientific ideas through artistic means.</p> <p>In Lanzhou, Gansu Province, we teamed up with community service centers and hospitals to deliver science popularization activities open to people of all ages. These events mainly included interactive games and informative lectures to make science accessible and enjoyable.</p> <p>On a national scale, we designed targeted educational programs to address regional gaps in resources. We also distributed printed handbooks on gut health knowledge to locations across the country, ensuring valuable health-related scientific knowledge reached more people.</p> <p>Globally, we developed and spread multilingual handbooks on gut health knowledge, shared science articles via WeChat official accounts, and created a guide advocating for educational equity. We are dedicated to removing all barriers to the spread of scientific knowledge\u2014whether those barriers are related to national borders, natural conditions, age, or gender.</p> <p>By adopting a precision-focused strategy, we have guaranteed that everyone\u2014no matter their age, ethnicity, gender, or background\u2014can access scientific knowledge. We successfully merged art and science, carrying out educational activities in lively, engaging ways that bring people together globally in spirit and purpose.</p>"},{"location":"human-practices/education/#our-view-of-education","title":"Our view of education","text":"<p>From our team\u2019s perspective, education has been invested with far deeper, more abundant meaning\u2014it extends well beyond simple knowledge indoctrination and skill instruction, evolving into a profound spiritual journey and a transformative feast of wisdom awakening. We firmly hold that the true essence of education, as articulated by French Enlightenment thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau, goes beyond merely sowing knowledge seeds in students\u2019 hearts; it also kindles the inner fire that drives them to explore the unknown and pursue truth, guiding them onto an extraordinary path of self-discovery and growth.</p> <p>The ancient Chinese sage Laozi once stated, \u201cGive a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.\u201d As a group of explorers fueled by scientific aspirations and a passion for education, we are dedicated to creating an open, inclusive, and innovative learning space. Here, every student can thrive freely on this fertile ground of knowledge and dare to push boundaries in their exploration. We believe the power of education lies in unlocking students\u2019 inherent learning potential. Through a project-based learning approach, we encourage students to think independently, engage in hands-on practice, and connect theoretical knowledge with real-world problems. This way, they deepen their understanding through experience, strengthen their resolve amid challenges, and learn to communicate and collaborate effectively in teamwork.</p> <p>On the iDEC platform, we urge students to dare to question and challenge authority. We also guide every member to pay attention to social hot topics, reflect on science and technology ethics, view the world through a scientific lens, and touch people\u2019s hearts with humanistic compassion. In various community initiatives, we put our acquired knowledge into practice to assist others\u2014this not only supports community residents but also serves as a valuable learning experience for every team member. Because we place great emphasis on spiritual connection and enlightenment, our ultimate goal in education is to nurture future leaders who possess independent thinking abilities, a strong sense of social responsibility, and genuine humanistic care. We are convinced that such education can cultivate interdisciplinary talents with both profound scientific literacy and noble moral character, thereby contributing to societal progress and development.</p> <p>In summary, the iDEC team\u2019s educational philosophy and mission center on prioritizing the enlightenment of the mind and the awakening of wisdom alongside imparting knowledge. By leveraging innovative educational methods, we stir up students\u2019 intrinsic drive, equipping them to become young people of the new era\u2014individuals with an innovative spirit, practical skills, a sense of social responsibility, and humanistic empathy. We firmly believe this is education in its truest form: one that not only illuminates students\u2019 futures but also lights the path for the advancement of human civilization.</p>"},{"location":"human-practices/education/#schools","title":"Schools","text":""},{"location":"human-practices/education/#1elementary-school","title":"1.Elementary school","text":""},{"location":"human-practices/education/#future-scientists-launch-program-co-hosted-by-lzu-medicine-china-and-lanzhou-childrens-palace-learning-synthetic-biology-to-enlighten-childrens-minds","title":"Future Scientists Launch Program Co-hosted by LZU-MEDICINE-CHINA and Lanzhou Children's Palace: Learning Synthetic Biology to Enlighten Children's Minds","text":"<p>Date: August 4, 2025</p> <p>Time: Monday morning at 9:00</p> <p>Location: Genetics Laboratory, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University</p> <p>In the summer of 2025, our team teamed up with Lanzhou Children's Palace to carry out a remarkable educational activity for primary school students.

On top of that, we fully integrated the ideas and insights of the team members through multiple forms of collaboration, such as offline group meetings and online real-time communication, to gradually clarify the core direction of the business plan, and ultimately established a preliminary overall framework and medium- and long-term development plan.</p> <p></p> <p>In addition, we also explored the actual needs of the market through field research and took the initiative to carry out in-depth exchanges with other outstanding innovation and entrepreneurship teams. This series of practice has given us a more intuitive and profound preliminary knowledge of the suitability of mainstream entrepreneurial models in the industry, the core resources required for project promotion, and the challenges we may face in the future, such as market competition and operational risks, which further provides practical support for the feasibility of the business plan on the ground.</p> <p></p> <p>After completing the initial knowledge of the innovation and entrepreneurship field, in order to further explore the market feasibility and potential of our product, we conducted targeted interviews with the medical industry, and had in-depth exchanges with a number of professional doctors and patients, obtaining valuable feedback.</p> <p>In the doctor interviews, doctors with different professional backgrounds provided differentiated key suggestions from their respective fields.

In his opinion, a good product consists of three aspects, i.e. technology, formulation and packaging appearance. Doing a good job on a product is not an easy task, and it requires strong multi-team collaboration behind it. In terms of technology, there is a need for an advanced technical team, with the technical team as a foundation, in order to develop a good formula, and only a good formula is not enough, the third element is also very important, that is, excellent product packaging design. Do a product, is a process from the inside out, and from the outside in. Not only the appearance of the design, this aspect also includes the design of the corporate culture and the design of the product background story, a good product not only need to have its shell and connotation, but also need to have a soul, need to have the corresponding story and corporate culture content as support. He said if we want to lead a team or start a business in the future, we need to focus on the corporate culture and the story behind it. We Chinese can use more Chinese style, after all, that is our speciality. In addition, the content of product brochures should be written in a sensible way. For example, Jinghong's brochures will include appropriate references, and this kind of rigour and seriousness is something that can be directly differentiated from the practices of many companies.</p> <p>Dialogue with Manager Liu let us gain a lot, we not only learned how to do a good product, how to improve our project, but also understand how to do a good business. We realised what kind of ability and quality a good entrepreneur should have. We also benefited from Manager Liu's emphasis on intellectual property protection. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Manager Liu. Mr Liu received us warmly and was very happy to share his experience and knowledge with us, and invited us to visit his offline shop, which gave us a deeper understanding of how a healthcare company should survive and grow in China. At the shop, Manager Liu introduced us to the location of the shop, how to make a profit, and explained some of the laws and regulations of the healthcare market in China. Manager Liu further introduced us to the types, differences and characteristics of the products that Jinghong carries.

While processing a large amount of food substrate daily, it also needs to maintain the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, the dynamic balance of the intestinal flora, and the stability of the immune defence. Its state of health not only directly determines the efficiency of nutrient decomposition and conversion (e.g. carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals), but also through multi-organ interaction pathways such as the \"intestinal-cerebral axis\", \"intestinal-hepatic axis\" and \"intestinal-lung axis\". Through the \"intestine-brain axis\", \"intestine-liver axis\", \"intestine-lung axis\" and other multi-organ interaction pathways, it has a systematic impact on the functional homeostasis of various systems in the whole body.</p> <p>From the perspective of modern medicine, the core of digestive health can be summarised as \"three-dimensional balance\": first, the balance of intestinal flora, i.e. the proportion of beneficial bacteria (e.g. Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium) and harmful bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas) is coordinated and the homeostasis of the metabolites of the flora (e.g. short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, TMAO) is achieved. Secondly, the intestinal mucosal barrier balance, including the integrity and synergy of the physical barrier, also known as the mechanical barrier (tight junctions of epithelial cells), the chemical barrier (mucus layer, antimicrobial peptides), the microbial barrier (mucosal flora and intestinal luminal flora), and the immune barrier (intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues); and thirdly, digestive metabolism balance, which refers to the orderly and efficient secretion of digestive enzymes, gastrointestinal dynamics regulation, and the process of nutrient absorption and transit. These three balances are interrelated and interact with each other to form the basis of digestive health, and any imbalance in any one of these dimensions may trigger a \"butterfly effect\", which can be transmitted to the whole body system to induce health problems.</p>"},{"location":"human-practices/entrepreneurship/#112-the-importance-of-digestive-health-to-general-health","title":"1.1.2 The importance of digestive health to general health","text":"<p>Nutritional supply: The digestive system is the \"processing plant\" and \"transfer station\" for human nutritional intake. After the food is chewed in the mouth and initially digested in the stomach, it is broken down by digestive enzymes such as pancreatic fluid and intestinal fluid into small molecules such as glucose, amino acids and fatty acids, and then enters into the blood circulation through the transporter of the epithelial cells of the small intestinal villi to provide energy and synthetic raw materials for the tissues and organs of the whole body. If the function of digestive system is impaired (such as the reduction of absorption area of intestinal mucosa caused by chronic enteritis, insufficient secretion of digestive enzymes caused by pancreatic insufficiency, etc.), it will directly trigger nutritional absorption disorders, leading to anaemia, osteoporosis, immune deficiency and other systemic nutritional diseases, and in serious cases, it even affects children's growth and development and the maintenance of organ function in adults.</p> <p></p> <p>Immune defence: The intestine is the largest immune organ in the human body, and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) accounts for more than 70% of the total number of immune cells in the whole body, including T-cells, B-cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and other immune cells, as well as immune molecules such as secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA). A healthy digestive system, through the dual regulation of \"immune tolerance\" and \"immune defence\", can not only identify and remove pathogenic bacteria, toxins and other harmful substances, but also avoid excessive immune responses (e.g., allergies, inflammation) to food antigens and beneficial flora. When the intestinal mucosal barrier is compromised (e.g., increased intestinal permeability, i.e., \"leaky gut\"), endotoxins (e.g., the lipopolysaccharide LPS) in the gut enter the blood circulation and activate the systemic inflammatory response system, inducing a chronic low-grade inflammatory state. This chronic inflammation is the common pathological basis of many chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), highlighting the central role of digestive health in maintaining systemic immune homeostasis.</p> <p></p> <p>Metabolic regulation: Intestinal flora, as the \"second genome of the human body\", is closely related to the metabolic health of the human body. Beneficial bacteria can produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) through fermentation of dietary fibre, of which butyric acid is the main source of energy for colonic epithelial cells, and can promote the repair of intestinal mucous membranes; propionic acid can be used in the liver through the blood circulation to inhibit gluconeogenesis and regulate the level of blood glucose; and acetic acid can be used in the adipose tissue to inhibit the synthesis of fat. In addition, the intestinal flora also participates in the hepatic and intestinal cycles of bile acids, and through the dehydroxylation and dehydrogenation of primary bile acids, secondary bile acids are generated, which in turn regulate hepatic fat metabolism and cholesterol synthesis. When the intestinal flora is imbalanced (e.g. increase of harmful bacteria and decrease of beneficial bacteria), the production of SCFAs decreases and the metabolism of secondary bile acids is disturbed, which will lead to a significant increase in the risk of metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, NAFLD, etc., and even lead to obesity and its related complications.</p> <p></p> <p>Neural regulation: The \"gut-brain axis\" is an important pathway connecting the digestive system and the central nervous system, and it can achieve two-way regulation through the three major pathways of nerves, endocrine and immunity. Intestinal flora can affect the central nervous system function through metabolites (such as SCFAs, tryptophan metabolite 5-hydroxytryptophan precursor): for example, 5-hydroxytryptophan, as an important neurotransmitter, not only participates in the regulation of gastrointestinal dynamics, but also enters into the brain through the blood circulation, affecting the mood, sleep and cognitive function; SCFAs can pass through the blood-brain barrier, regulate the activity of microglia, inhibit neuroinflammation, and have a positive effect on the development of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other diseases. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases have potential protective effects. When the intestinal flora is imbalanced, the regulation of the \"gut-brain axis\" is disturbed, which may induce anxiety, depression and other psychosomatic problems, as well as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other \"psychosomatic disorders\", which reflects the important impact of digestive health on the health of the nervous system.</p>"},{"location":"human-practices/entrepreneurship/#113-correlation-between-digestive-health-and-systemic-health","title":"1.1.3 Correlation between digestive health and systemic health","text":"<p>Intestinal-liver axis: as the largest metabolic organ in the body, the liver is directly connected to the intestinal tract through the portal vein system, and nutrients, bacterial metabolites, and endotoxins in the intestinal tract need to be processed by entering the liver through the portal vein. In a healthy state, the liver can remove harmful substances from the intestinal tract through detoxification, and at the same time provide the intestinal tract with digestive aids such as bile acids; however, when there is an imbalance in the intestinal flora (e.g., an increase in the number of harmful bacteria leads to an increase in the production of endotoxin) or the intestinal mucosal barrier is impaired (an increase in endotoxin entry into the bloodstream), excessive endotoxin activates an inflammatory response in the liver, which induces damage to the hepatocytes and hepatic fibrosis, and in the long term can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver failure. , and liver failure. In addition, bile acid metabolism disorders involved in intestinal flora can lead to increased fat synthesis in the liver, inducing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and further development of NAFLD can lead to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatocellular carcinoma and other serious liver diseases, resulting in a vicious cycle of \"intestinal imbalance - liver damage\".</p> <p>Intestinal-lung axis: Although the intestines and lungs are anatomically distant from each other, they are closely related through migration of immune cells, cytokine signalling and diffusion of flora metabolites. When the intestinal flora is imbalanced, the inflammatory factors produced in the intestines will enter the blood circulation and activate the immune cells in the lungs, inducing chronic inflammation in the lungs; at the same time, some metabolites of the intestinal flora can reach the lungs through the bloodstream, destroying the barrier of the lung mucous membranes, and increasing the risk of lung infections (e.g., pneumonia). In addition, the occurrence of respiratory diseases, such as allergic asthma, is also closely related to the abnormalities of immune tolerance caused by the imbalance of intestinal flora: insufficient diversity of intestinal flora in childhood leads to the over-activation of Th2-type immune responses and increases the probability of asthmaClinical studies have shown that symptom severity and lung function in asthma patients can be improved by regulating gut flora (e.g., probiotic supplementation), confirming the strong link between digestive health and lung health.</p> <p>[ T.

When the intestinal flora is imbalanced, intestinal permeability increases, endotoxins and food antigens enter the blood circulation and activate systemic inflammatory responses, leading to abnormal proliferation of keratinocytes and sebaceous gland secretion disorders, which in turn induce acne; at the same time, metabolic disorders of the intestinal flora can lead to inadequate absorption of B vitamins (e.g., vitamins B2 and B6), which are key nutrients for skin mucosal repair, and their deficiency can exacerbate Skin inflammation. In addition, gut flora can influence the skin's immune defences by regulating the immune system: for example, SCFAs produced by beneficial bacteria can suppress skin inflammation, whereas endotoxins produced by harmful bacteria can trigger skin allergies, further demonstrating the intrinsic link between digestive health and skin health.</p> <p>Intestinal-Cardiovascular Axis: The occurrence of cardiovascular diseases is closely related to intestinal health, and the core mechanism lies in the role of intestinal flora metabolites in regulating the cardiovascular system. Intestinal flora can metabolise choline and phosphatidylcholine from food into trimethylamine (TMA), which is oxidised by the liver to produce trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) [ WANG Z N, WILSON TANG W H, BUFFA J A, et al.

Clinical studies have shown that the proportion of TMA-producing harmful bacteria in the intestinal flora of patients with cardiovascular disease is significantly higher than that of healthy people, and that the level of TMAO in the blood is positively correlated with the severity of cardiovascular disease. In addition, chronic low-grade inflammation caused by imbalance of intestinal flora will further aggravate the vascular inflammatory response and accelerate the process of atherosclerosis; whereas SCFAs produced by beneficial bacteria can play a protective role in the cardiovascular system by dilating blood vessels, lowering blood pressure and inhibiting inflammation.

The development of China's gastroenterology profession has gone through an arduous process from scratch, from weak to strong. Before the founding of New China, there was basically no professional discipline of gastroenterology in China, and the diagnosis and treatment of digestive diseases lacked systematicity and specialisation. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the development of gastroenterology has gone through three distinct phases: the founding period from the early period of the founding of the People's Republic of China to the Cultural Revolution, the low-tide period at the time of the Cultural Revolution, and the developmental period from 1978 onwards to the present time [ Pan Guozong. Gastroenterology in China at the turn of the century[J]. Chinese Journal of Gastroenterology,2000,(03):46-50.J].</p> <p>Founding period (from the early period of the founding of the People's Republic of China to the Cultural Revolution): the core task was to build a basic diagnostic and therapeutic framework. With the initial establishment of the modern medical system, gastroenterology was gradually separated from internal medicine and began to form a professional diagnostic and treatment team. At this time, the focus of the industry was concentrated on \"solving urgent medical needs\" - targeting highly prevalent infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever, and taking therapeutic drugs as the core products, through the large-scale supply of antibiotics, rehydration preparations, etc., to quickly control the spread of the epidemic. At this stage, the industry was dominated by a handful of state-owned pharmaceutical companies, with \"treating diseases\" as the only goal of medical treatment, and the concept of \"prevention\" had not yet entered the public's consciousness, and primary healthcare's ability to intervene in digestive diseases was virtually non-existent.</p> <p>Low period (Cultural Revolution period): Industry development was stagnant, but there were still local breakthroughs in technology application. Subject to the overall social environment, the construction of disciplines and scientific research progress slowed down, but the clinical demand for \"more accurate diagnosis\" drove the initial exploration of the device field. Gastroenteroscopy, capsule endoscopy and other screening equipment began to be applied on a small scale, and minimally invasive interventional techniques were tried to be used in the treatment of peptic ulcers, bleeding and other diseases, which not only filled the gaps in diagnostic and therapeutic means at that time, but also more importantly allowed the awareness of early detection of diseases to begin to germinate in some hospitals, which contributed to the transformation of the industry into a \"combination of prevention and treatment\". \"Combination of prevention and treatment\" transformation for the subsequent industry to lay the groundwork. At this time, the industry was dominated by leading equipment companies and large general hospitals, while primary healthcare institutions still found it difficult to carry out standardised screening and treatment of digestive diseases due to a lack of resources.</p> <p>Development period (1978-present): The industry entered the stage of rapid development of \"diversification and precision\". After the reform and opening up, changes in dietary structure brought about by economic upgrading and mental stress triggered by the accelerated pace of life combined to drive a fundamental shift in the spectrum of digestive diseases - infectious diseases associated with \"poverty and poor hygiene\" gradually faded away, and diseases caused by \"high-fat, high-protein diets\" gradually faded away. Instead, infectious diseases associated with \"poverty and poor hygiene\" have gradually faded out, while \"diseases of affluence\" (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux, fatty liver, colorectal cancer) and functional gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome) triggered by \"high-fat, high-protein diets, sedentary lifestyles, and mental anxiety\" have become the mainstream. This change has directly pushed the industry to shift from \"treatment-oriented\" to \"both prevention and treatment\", and the product form has expanded from a single drug to \"probiotics, digestive enzymes, dietary fibre\" and other At the same time, digital tools such as intestinal flora testing, AI-assisted diagnosis, and remote management have been integrated into the diagnosis and treatment process to achieve the synergy of \"in-hospital diagnosis and treatment + out-of-hospital management\".</p> Stage Time Market/Product Policies \uff06Events Patterns \uff06 Impacts Treatment-oriented Early National Period to the Cultural Revolution Therapeutic drug-based Construction of Modern Diagnosis and Treatment System Pharmaceutical companies dominate, focusing on treatment but not prevention Instruments and Screening during the Cultural Revolution Gastroenteroscopy, Capsule Endoscopy, Minimally Invasive Intervention Promotion of primary speciality construction Leading equipment companies and general hospitals dominate, awareness of screening is emerging Prevention and numbers 1978 onwards to the present Probiotics / Digestive Enzymes / Dietary Fibre; Gut Flora Testing, AI Assisted Diagnosis, Remote Management Healthy China 2030; OTC and Consumer Grade Penetration Increase In-hospital and out-of-hospital synergy, new forces account for an increased proportion <p>At the same time, people's awareness of gastrointestinal health is also increasing, and their spending power in this area is also rising. In terms of consumer awareness and market landscape, the industry has undergone three key transformations:</p> <p>Traditional tonic stage (1980s): Health demand remained at the level of \"basic nutritional supplementation\". Restricted by the economic level and health awareness, consumers' understanding of digestive health was only \"relief of gastrointestinal discomfort\", and the market was dominated by natural nutrients such as honey and jujubes, with a single product category and a lack of scientific efficacy verification system. At this time, local brands are just starting out, the regulatory system is in the initial stage of establishment, the market order is based on \"quality compliance\" as the minimum requirements, and has not yet formed a differentiated competitive landscape.</p> <p>Nutrition and basic probiotics stage (1990s): health needs escalated to \"targeted nutritional supplementation\". With the improvement of national living standards, consumers began to pay attention to the role of vitamins, minerals and other basic nutrients to support the digestive function, and at the same time, the concept of probiotics was introduced from abroad, and basic probiotic products (e.g., single-strain yoghurt, ordinary live bacteria preparations) began to enter the market. Foreign-funded enterprises quickly seized the market by virtue of technological advantages and brand influence, while local enterprises participated in the competition through imitation and low-priced strategy to promote the rapid expansion of the market scale. However, at this time, the products mostly stayed at the level of \"broad-spectrum conditioning\" and lacked the targeted design for specific populations and scenarios, and the focus of the competition was concentrated on the \"price and channel\". The focus of competition is concentrated on \"price and channels\" rather than \"efficacy and technology\".</p> <p>Functional segmentation and digital management stage (2000s to present): Health demand has entered the stage of \"personalisation and precision\". Consumers' perception of digestive health is no longer limited to \"symptom relief\", but rather the pursuit of \"long-term maintenance of intestinal micro-ecological balance\", which drives the development of products in the direction of functional segmentation - targeting Constipation, diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome and other specific problems of probiotic preparations, combined with digestive enzymes and dietary fibre compound formula products continue to emerge. At the same time, policy support for the health industry has increased, the penetration of OTC channels and consumer health platforms has moved digestive health products from \"medical scenarios\" to \"daily consumption scenarios\", and the application of digital tools (e.g., intestinal flora testing APP, AI health consulting) has further enabled the development of digestive health products. The application of digital tools (e.g. intestinal flora testing APP, AI health consulting) further realises the whole-process management of \"testing-intervention-follow-up\", and the industry pattern has gradually shifted from \"dominated by foreign investors\" to \"competition between local new forces and foreign investors\". The industry landscape has gradually shifted from \"foreign domination\" to \"local new forces competing with foreign ones\", and new enterprises are continuously increasing their market share by virtue of their accurate grasp of local consumers' needs and digital service capabilities.</p> Stage Duration Category Regulation and Channels Pattern and Impact Traditional Tonic 1980s Honey, dates, goji berries and other supplements Gradual establishment of regulatory system Local brands start with a single category Nutrition &amp; Basic Probiotics 1990s Vitamins/minerals, basic probiotics Influx of foreign and local enterprises Competition intensifies as market expands Functional Segmentation &amp; Number Management 2000s to present Probiotics, digestive enzymes, and other categories have increased Policy support for health industry Deepening segmentation and rise of digital services"},{"location":"human-practices/entrepreneurship/#22-development-trend-forecast","title":"2.2 Development Trend Forecast","text":""},{"location":"human-practices/entrepreneurship/#221-policy-guidance-and-regulatory-environment","title":"2.2.1 Policy guidance and regulatory environment","text":"<p>The influence of policies on the digestive health industry is shifting from \"macro-guidance\" to \"fine specification and precise support\", forming a multi-level policy system of \"national strategic leadership, local practice, and industry standard improvement\".

The value of this type of project lies not only in the \"early detection and treatment\" of diseases, but also in the cultivation of public awareness of digestive health screening - through the provision of free non-invasive screening services such as faecal DNA methylation testing and H. pylori testing, the public will be able to \"check their gut health regularly\". Through the provision of free non-invasive screening services such as faecal DNA methylation testing and H. pylori testing, \"regular intestinal health check\" has become a habit for residents, which in turn drives the demand for subsequent health intervention products. At the same time, through cooperation with enterprises, local governments combine testing services with product interventions (e.g., probiotics, nutritional preparations) to form a closed loop of \"testing-assessment-intervention\", which not only creates stable market demand for enterprises, but also transforms the policy dividend into a real benefit for the health of the entire population.</p> <p>In the future, there will be two major trends in the regulatory environment: first, the gradual improvement of the classification and regulatory system - for probiotics, intestinal flora testing and other products, to clarify the classification criteria of \"medical-grade\" and \"consumer-grade\", to avoid enterprises from \"medical-grade\" and \"consumer-grade\" products.

Now, with the deepening awareness of \"the link between intestinal microecology and systemic health\", consumers are beginning to regard digestive health as \"the foundation of systemic health\", and the demand has shifted from \"passive treatment\" to \"active prevention\". --They are no longer satisfied with \"solving the current problem\", but hope to avoid the risk of chronic diseases (e.g. fatty liver, cardiovascular disease) in the future through long-term and continuous intervention (e.g. daily probiotic supplementation, regular intestinal flora testing). This shift in philosophy has pushed the market from \"symptom-oriented products\" (e.g. anti-diarrhoeal drugs, stomach pills) to \"long-term management products\" (e.g. daily probiotics, dietary fibre supplements), and has also required companies to provide \"test-assessment-intervention-follow-up\" (e.g. daily probiotics, regular testing of intestinal flora). Meanwhile, companies are also required to provide a full-cycle service of \"test-assessment-intervention-follow-up\" rather than a single product.</p> <p>Consumers' demand for \"effectiveness and safety\" has forced the industry to shift from \"marketing-driven\" to \"research-driven\". In the past, some companies seized the market through exaggerated publicity (e.g. \"cure constipation\", \"boost immunity\") and low-priced promotions, which led consumers to question the effectiveness of the products; nowadays, consumers are more concerned about the \"scientific basis\" when choosing digestive health products. Nowadays, when choosing digestive health products, consumers are more concerned about the \"scientific basis\", i.e. whether there is clinical research data to support the efficacy of the product, whether the survival rate of the strain has been verified by a third party, and whether there are potential side effects. This change in demand has led to the gradual elimination of products with \"no clinical validation and ambiguous efficacy\" from the market, while products with clear scientific research endorsement (e.g., university co-operation in R&amp;D, certification by authoritative organisations), and quantifiable effects (e.g., \"improves regularity of defecation in 7 days\") have been eliminated from the market. Products with clear scientific backing (e.g., research and development by universities, certification by authorities) and quantifiable effects (e.g., \"improves bowel regularity in 7 days\", \"reduces the proportion of harmful intestinal bacteria\") are more popular. Meanwhile, consumers' preference for \"natural and additive-free\" products has also pushed companies to reduce preservatives, sweeteners and other ingredients in their formulations, and shift to safer natural ingredients and processes.</p> <p>Personalisation and diversification of demand have pushed the market into the stage of \"precise segmentation\". The demand for digestive health products is significantly different among different groups of people due to differences in age, living habits, and health conditions: white-collar women in first- and second-tier cities face the problems of \"sedentary lifestyle, takeaway diets, and high mental stress\", and demand is focused on \"convenient and efficient\" products. The demand focuses on \"convenient and efficient\" product forms (e.g. ready-to-drink probiotics, portable capsules), as well as the synergistic effect of the products on the skin condition and endocrine system; the elderly group, due to the decline of intestinal function, needs mild products for constipation and irritable bowel syndrome, and has high demands on the convenience of the products (e.g. easy to swallow, no need for refrigeration); the maternal group is concerned about the effect of the products on the fetal intestinal tract. Pregnant women, on the other hand, are concerned about the impact of the product on the intestinal health of the foetus, and prefer probiotic preparations that are antibiotic-free and have been proven to be safe during pregnancy. This segmented demand not only gives rise to more targeted products, but also pushes companies to shift from \"mass production\" to \"flexible customisation\", and enhance user stickiness by providing personalised health solutions (e.g. recommending exclusive strains based on the results of intestinal flora tests).</p>"},{"location":"human-practices/entrepreneurship/#223-technological-innovation-and-product-upgrading","title":"2.2.3 Technological innovation and product upgrading","text":"<p>Technological innovation is the core driving force for the development of the digestive health industry. At present, the industry is undergoing transformation and upgrading from traditional products to high-tech content products.

For example, GUTX has developed the \"Dual-Compartment Fresh\" technology, which ensures that the probiotics maintain the best active state before drinking through the powder-liquid separation design, and the probiotics are quickly awakened and enter the intestinal tract in the freshest state through one-click mixing. http://www.chinadevelopment.com.cn/zxsd/2025/0818/ 1956669.shtml].</p> <p>Formulation innovation is also an important direction: BEE+ Stomach Shield adopts the \"three-stage golden stomach formula\" formed by Manuka honey, curcumin and sea buckthorn, which eliminates the cause of disease, anti-inflammatory repair and consolidation of protection as the underlying logic, to achieve the long-term maintenance of the gastrointestinal barrier in the whole chain. The product also uses patented ultra-micron import technology to micronise ingredients such as curcumin, which can be rapidly absorbed without physical digestion and improve bioavailability.</p> <p>Advances in diagnostic and monitoring technology have also provided new opportunities for industry development.

One is surgical patients, especially those undergoing major surgeries such as gastrointestinal, orthopaedic and oncology operations. These patients have a high incidence of perioperative intestinal dysbiosis and face a high risk of postoperative infections, intestinal dysfunction and other complications, and clinically there is an urgent need for effective intestinal regulation, and the project's metabolically engineered bacterium is able to precisely regulate intestinal flora and inhibit inflammation, which can be very well suited to the rigid needs of this medical scenario. The other category is the middle-aged and elderly families of surgical patients, who, as the main body of decision-making and payment of medical consumption, are very concerned about the quality of post-operative rehabilitation and prevention of complications, and have a strong demand for products that \"reduce medical risks and subsequent expenditures\", and are willing to pay for professional medical-grade products, and at the same time are more likely to come into contact with the relevant products through the hospital channel.

On the one hand, it achieves precise targeting, responding to intestinal bile salt signals through the p16090 promoter, so that the engineered bacteria can be specifically activated in the intestinal tract, avoiding systemic side effects, and effectively solving the pain point of traditional probiotics, which is \"fuzzy action scenes and unstable effects\"; on the other hand, it achieves clear efficacy, integrating OLE1, On the other hand, the efficacy is clear, the integration of OLE1 and accA genes enhances the expression of oleic acid (OA), and at the same time synergises with DEFB4A gene to regulate the immune system, which can inhibit the harmful bacteria that are prone to infections in the perioperative period, such as Escherichia coli and enterococci, etc, and also alleviate the intestinal inflammation, so that it can intervene in the dual dimensions of \"bacterial regulation and immune restoration\". Compared with single probiotics or prebiotics, it is more targeted to the complex intestinal problems during surgery.</p> <p>In terms of scenario differentiation, the project focuses on \"perioperative medical scenarios\", filling a gap in the clinical field. Traditional digestive health products are mostly oriented to daily care, but lack precise solutions for special physiological conditions before and after surgery, such as fasting, traumatic stress, antibiotic use, etc. The project's engineered bacteria can be suitable for perioperative medical conditions. The engineered bacteria of this project can adapt to the microecological characteristics of the intestinal tract during the perioperative period, optimise the intestinal flora structure of patients and reduce the risk of infection before surgery, and help the recovery of intestinal function after surgery, thus becoming an innovative supplement to the \"accelerated recovery in perioperative period (ERAS)\" system, and through the in-depth combination of the clinical pathway in hospitals, it will build up an exclusive competitive barrier in the medical field. It also builds up a competitive barrier exclusive to the medical scene by deeply integrating with the clinical pathway of hospitals.</p> <p>Focusing on value differentiation, the medical and consumer values of the products are outstanding. In terms of medical value, after the product has passed clinical validation, it can be used as an auxiliary medical tool for perioperative intestinal management, and be incorporated into hospital prescriptions or clinical pathways, providing doctors with new treatment tools and helping to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications, such as the infection rate is expected to be reduced by 30%, and the length of intestinal paralysis will be shortened by 12 hours, creating more value for the medical side. In terms of consumer value, for daily intestinal care users, the product can provide long-term health benefits of \"precise prevention of surgical risks\" and \"repair of chronic intestinal damage\", which is different from the limitations of ordinary probiotics of \"short-term relief\".

Secondly, safety concerns, perioperative patients with low immunity, the \"foreign bacterial agent\" safety requirements are extremely high, they are worried that ordinary probiotics may carry drug-resistant genes, triggering infections, or due to the instability of bacterial strains affecting the efficacy of the treatment, so they do not dare to try easily. In addition, the poor convenience of use is also a major pain point, most of the existing products are oral capsules or powders, perioperative patients may have difficulty swallowing, intestinal absorption obstacles and other problems, and the lack of \"preoperative - intraoperative - postoperative\" whole cycle of the use of the programme guidance, which undoubtedly increases the operating costs of healthcare personnel and patients.</p> <p>In daily consumption, there are also many pain points in the demand for daily intestinal care.

Then we went to the school laboratory to do the \"Engineering Bacteria Cultivation Experiment\", and operated the microscope to observe the difference between probiotics and harmful bacteria; finally and most importantly, we \"shared\" what we learnt with our family members: we gave our parents a lecture on \"Why you can't take antibiotics casually? Last but not least, share what you've learned with your family: tell mom and dad \"why you shouldn't take antibiotics\", show grandparents \"how to see the number of live bacteria in a probiotic\", and make a small video of a \"family dialogue on intestinal health\". A medical student said after the family sharing, \"My mother used to always buy 'net red probiotics' for my brother, and I told her, 'Look at the strain to see if it has a patent and whether there is any clinical data', and she now asks me before she buys it, and she feels that she has really helped her family. she's really helping her family.\" We hope that in this way, college students can \"use\" the knowledge they learnt in the classroom, not only to get credits, but also to become a \"health bridge\" connecting campus and home.</p> <p>(3) Scholarships: Conducted in colleges and universities, we set up the \"Beneficial Bowel Activity Scholarship\", which awards 100 college students who have completed 50 hours of community volunteering each year, with a prize of 10,000 RMB/person; we also provide through-train slots for the iDEC and synthetic biology competitions</p> <p>We set up the \"Scholarship for Beneficial Intestinal Activities\" not to \"reward students with good grades\", but to encourage more university students to go into the community and turn their professional knowledge into \"practical help \". Students who receive the scholarship are required to complete 50 hours of community volunteer activities first: it may be teaching \"bowel care\" to the elderly at a community health talk, helping residents register their information on a public health clinic bus, or bringing a \"small bowel health class\" to children in the community \". We also provide these students with \"through-train places\" in iDEC and synthetic biology competitions - with a professional research team to guide them in their projects, and the opportunity to turn gut health problems identified in the community into innovative solutions in the competitions. One student found out during his community service that many elderly people didn't know that \"probiotics should be kept refrigerated\", which led to the failure of the powder, so he designed a \"probiotic package with temperature alerts\", and won an award in the competition. We hope to use the scholarship to build a \"practice - innovation\" platform, so that university students can both harvest growth in public welfare and realise the value in research.</p>"},{"location":"human-practices/entrepreneurship/#823-community-co-creation-workshop-micro-lab-in-box","title":"8.2.3 Community Co-creation Workshop - Micro-Lab in Box","text":"<p>In the communities of Shanghai and Shenzhen, we have set up \"Micro-Lab in Box\", where there are no complicated instruments, but only \"Oleic Acid Test Boxes\" that residents can operate by themselves.

We aim to provide a replicable \"Gansu experience\" for building a healthier, more resilient, and more compassionate future society.</p> <p>In this era of information explosion, we were startled to discover that fundamental knowledge about gut health remains severely lacking among the general grassroots population. According to our preliminary research, many rural residents are completely unaware of the basic functions of gut microbiota, with nearly 70% of respondents attributing intestinal infections simplistically to \"eating spoiled food\" while possessing minimal awareness of preventive measures. This knowledge gap is not confined to rural areas\u2014it is equally pronounced among urban low-income groups, elderly populations, and ethnic minority communities. The widespread disparity in health literacy prompted us to launch a series of targeted health promotion initiatives.</p> <p>Our practice demonstrates that effective health knowledge dissemination requires breaking away from the traditional one-way communication model and adopting new, participatory, and experiential approaches. With support from the Gansu Red Cross Society, we innovatively integrated health knowledge into interactive games and simulations, enabling participants to master health skills through practice. This innovative approach not only improves the efficiency of knowledge dissemination but, more importantly, stimulates public initiative and enthusiasm for learning health knowledge.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"human-practices/inclusivity/#eliminating-the-gap-in-intestinal-health-knowledge-a-systematic-project-from-knowledge-to-action","title":"Eliminating the Gap in Intestinal Health Knowledge: A Systematic Project from \"Knowledge\" to \"Action\"","text":""},{"location":"human-practices/inclusivity/#1-in-depth-analysis-of-the-problem-information-silos-and-cognitive-gaps","title":"1.

This knowledge deficit is systemic: it stems from a relative shortage of high-quality educational resources, a disconnect between popular science content and local cultural context, and the ineffectiveness of traditional didactic education. Our preliminary research uncovered an alarming phenomenon: many children can recognize popular cartoon characters but cannot name the exact location of the heart; they know that getting pricked by a needle causes pain, yet most do not understand how to properly clean a wound to prevent infection. This highlights a significant cognitive disconnect between everyday experiences and scientific knowledge.</p> <p>Our core reflection: The dissemination of health knowledge must go beyond the one-way transmission of information. It must be a profound process of \"translation\" and \"connection,\" translating abstract medical principles into a language accessible to children, and connecting external knowledge to their internal cognitive structures and daily behaviors. This is the underlying logic behind all our actions.</p> <p>Our reflections: Health is the cornerstone of development, and inequality in medical knowledge is an unfair starting point. While urban children are already learning programming and robotics, rural children are still struggling to understand the mysteries of the body.

It not only participates in the breakdown and absorption of nutrients but also remotely regulates the host's physiological state through multiple pathways such as the \"gut-brain axis\" and the \"gut-liver axis.\" In healthy individuals, the microbiota maintains a dynamic balance, with different microbial communities constraining and cooperating with one another, functioning like a highly sophisticated ecological system. However, this delicate balance is highly susceptible to external disturbances, among which surgical procedures and related interventions are major factors disrupting the microbiota equilibrium.</p> <p>The perioperative period, marked by rapid physiological changes, is a critical stage often accompanied by significant disturbances in the internal environment. Factors such as preoperative fasting, prophylactic use of antibiotics, effects of anesthesia, surgical trauma-induced stress, and postoperative administration of analgesics collectively create a \"multifaceted assault\" on the gut microbiota. For example, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, while effectively preventing surgical site infections, inevitably suppresses the growth of numerous beneficial microbes, creating opportunities for opportunistic pathogens to thrive. Meanwhile, systemic inflammatory responses and sympathetic activation induced by surgical trauma lead to reduced intestinal blood flow and damage to the mucosal barrier, exacerbating the disruption of the microbial community, and turn affect the host's immune regulation and energy metabolism.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1. Changes in Gut Microbiota Across Different Stages</p> <p>When the stability of the gut microbiota is disrupted, its consequences often extend beyond the local environment, impacting multiple systemic functions and leading to a wide range of diseases. Examples include inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Furthermore, a dysbiotic microbiota may influence the functional state of the central nervous system through pathways such as the vagus nerve and immune cell migration. This disruption has been potentially linked to the development of neurological complications such as postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 2. Incidence of various systemic diseases during the perioperative period</p> <p>Currently, intervention strategies for perioperative gut microbiota dysbiosis exhibit significant limitations. Traditional microbiome-based formulations, such as probiotics and prebiotics, have shown some potential in clinical applications. However, their efficacy is often inconsistent due to factors such as strain selection, colonization resistance, and individual variability. While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can achieve a more thorough reconstruction of the microbiota, its application in the perioperative setting is hindered by challenges related to ethics, safety, and practicality. More importantly, these approaches are largely limited to passive supplementation or overall replacement, lacking the capacity for precise regulation of specific pathological processes. This makes it challenging to achieve efficient and orderly microbial restoration within the complex environment of surgical stress.</p> <p>Therefore, we have designed the \"Gut Health Guardian\" project, aiming to develop a functionally robust and biologically safe engineered probiotic. This probiotic is intended to rapidly occupy the ecological niches of missing beneficial bacteria when gut microbiota dysbiosis occurs and to produce prebiotics that are otherwise deficient in the gut. Additionally, it will repair the mucosal barrier and restore the functional balance of the gut microbiota. This innovative approach will serve as a model therapeutic strategy for addressing perioperative digestive system disorders.</p>"},{"location":"project/description/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Our project aims to develop a synthetic biology-based bioreactor leveraging Lactobacillus casei to precisely address perioperative gut microbiota dysbiosis and its associated pathological changes. The core design philosophy revolves around constructing a multifunctional, self-regulating engineered bacterium capable of intelligently executing three key tasks within the complex gut environment: \"repairing the mucosal barrier, suppressing pathogenic bacteria, and ensuring safety.\"</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3. Fatty acid synthesis pathway</p> <p>We selected Lactobacillus casei, known for its excellent probiotic properties, as the chassis cell and genetically engineered it to enhance its therapeutic functions. First, to strengthen the intestinal barrier, we introduced two key metabolic genes. The first is the accA gene derived from Lactobacillus, which enhances the engineered bacterium's capacity to synthesize short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The second is the OLE1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoding a desaturase that converts SCFAs into oleic acid. Oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid, is a critical component of epithelial cell membrane phospholipids, and its local supplementation has been shown to directly promote mucosal repair and epithelial barrier integrity. To ensure spatial specificity of the therapeutic effect, we employed the bile-responsive promoter P16090 to precisely control the expression of OLE1. This ensures that oleic acid synthesis is activated exclusively in the gut, where bile salts are abundant, thereby minimizing the risk of systemic side effects.</p> <p>Secondly, to achieve precise antagonism of conditional pathogens, we integrated the human DEFB4A gene, encoding human beta-defensin 2, into the engineered bacterium. Defensins, as broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides, effectively kill or inhibit a wide range of opportunistic pathogens, such as Gram-negative bacteria, while leaving most beneficial microbiota largely unaffected. This provides a robust tool for restoring a healthy microbial balance after disruptions caused by antibiotics.</p> <p>To ensure biosafety, we designed a bile salt-responsive toxin-antitoxin system (Hok/Sok) regulated by the same bile-responsive promoter, P16090. The core logic of this system is as follows: When the engineered bacteria reside in the gut, P16090 is activated by bile salts, driving the expression of therapeutic genes while simultaneously suppressing the expression of the Hok toxin. However, if the engineered bacteria escape into environments with low or no bile salts (e.g., external environments or non-intestinal tissues), the P16090 promoter ceases activity. This results in the rapid expression of the Hok toxin, leading to cell death and ensuring the bacteria are swiftly eliminated. This safety mechanism prevents persistent survival or spread of the engineered bacteria in unintended environments, fundamentally mitigating ecological and biosafety risks.</p> <p>In summary, the engineered Lactobacillus casei we designed integrates three core functional modules: sensing (bile salt signaling), execution (oleic acid and defensin synthesis), and safety control (Hok/Sok toxin-antitoxin system). It is far more than a simple probiotic substitute; it is a \"living therapeutic platform\" capable of intelligently responding to the gut environment, actively repairing the epithelial barrier, precisely inhibiting pathogens, and incorporating an efficient biosafety switch. This innovative design holds the potential to provide an unprecedentedly precise, safe, and powerful intervention strategy for maintaining gut microbiota stability during the perioperative period.</p>"},{"location":"project/description/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>[1] KURDI M, BAJWA S J S, SHARMA R, et al.
