## 1. Medium and reagent preparation

This section provides detailed methods for preparing various media and reagents required for constructing and verifying engineered strains. All procedures must be conducted in a clean environment. For liquid compositions, ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ·cm) should be used, and aseptic techniques must be strictly followed.

### 1.1. LB Medium

Reagents Required: Tryptone, yeast extract, sodium chloride, agar powder (for solid medium), deionized water, sodium hydroxide pellets, or concentrated hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment).

**LB Liquid Medium:**

(1) Weigh 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of sodium chloride into an appropriate beaker or Erlenmeyer flask.

(2) Add approximately 800 mL of deionized water and stir with a magnetic stirrer until fully dissolved.

(3) Make up the volume to 1 L with deionized water.

(4) Measure the solution's pH using a pH meter and adjust it to 7.0–7.4 using a small amount of NaOH or HCl.

(5) Aliquot the prepared medium into suitable containers (e.g., test tubes or flasks) and seal them properly.

(6) Sterilize by autoclaving at 121°C for 20 minutes. After sterilization, store at room temperature or in a refrigerator at 4°C for later use.

**LB Solid Medium:**

(1)Follow steps 1–4 of the liquid LB protocol, but add 15 g of agar powder before making up the volume.

(2) After volumetric adjustment, proceed to autoclave sterilization.

(3) After sterilization, cool the medium to around 55–60°C (warm to the touch but not hot). Add appropriate antibiotics or other heat-sensitive additives as required, then mix gently without introducing bubbles.

(4) Pour the medium into sterile petri dishes in the laminar hood (approximately 20–25 mL per dish), cover the plates, and leave a slight gap for vapor to disperse.

(5) Once solidified, invert the plates, seal the edges with parafilm, and store them in a 4°C refrigerator.

### 2.2. Experimental Procedures

**Stage 1: Strain Resuscitation and Seed Culture Preparation**

Streak Plate Resuscitation:

(1) In a sterile environment, use a sterile inoculation loop to pick a small amount of frozen glycerol stock or a single colony from the original plate.

(2) Perform a three-zone streak on a pre-warmed LB solid agar plate to obtain isolated single colonies.

(3) Invert the plate and incubate it at 37°C for 24–48 hours.

Seed Culture Preparation:

(6) Incubate at 37°C while shaking at 150 rpm (or keep stationary for static culture) for 12–16 hours until the medium becomes visibly turbid (OD₆₀₀ ≈ 1.0). This serves as the seed culture.

**Stage 2: Bile Salt Tolerance Test - Liquid Culture Analysis**

Preparation of Bile Salt-Supplemented Medium:

(1) Prepare sterile Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing a fixed volume of LB liquid medium.

(2) Using sterile techniques, add the required amount of 10% bile salt stock solution to achieve final concentrations of 0% (control), 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.5%.

(3) Mix thoroughly by gently swirling.

Inoculation and Cultivation:

(1) Inoculate the pre-prepared seed culture into bile salt-supplemented LB media at a 1:100 dilution ratio (e.g., 100 μL seed culture into 10 mL medium).

(2) Set up at least two parallel replicates for each bile salt concentration.

(3) Place the flasks into a shaking incubator at 37°C, shaking at 200 rpm.

Growth Curve Plotting:

(2) Measure the optical density at 600 nm (OD₆₀₀) using a spectrophotometer, using the respective uninoculated medium at the same concentration as a blank control.

(3) Record the OD₆₀₀ values and plot growth curves with time on the x-axis and OD₆₀₀ (mean value) on the y-axis for each bile salt concentration.

**Stage 3: Bile Salt Tolerance Test - Solid Culture Analysis**

Preparation of Bile Salt-Supplemented Agar Plates:

(1) Autoclave LB solid medium and cool to approximately 55°C.

(2) Add the desired volume of 10% bile salt stock solution into the medium under sterile conditions to prepare final concentrations of 0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.5%.

(3) Mix quickly and pour the medium into sterile Petri dishes to form solid agar plates.

Bacterial Dilution and Plate Spreading:

(1) Dilute the seed culture in sterile physiological saline to prepare a series of 10-fold dilutions, selecting an appropriate dilution to achieve 30–300 CFU per plate.

(2) Pipette 100 μL of the diluted bacterial suspension onto the center of each agar plate with the corresponding bile salt concentration.

(3) Use a sterile spreader to evenly distribute the bacterial suspension across the agar surface.

Incubation and Observation:

(1) Allow the liquid on the plate to be absorbed.

(2) Invert the plates and incubate them at 37°C for 24–48 hours.

(3) Observe and compare the colony size, morphology, and density across different bile salt concentrations.

(4) For countable plates (30–300 CFU/plate), count the colonies and calculate the viable bacterial concentration in the original seed culture (CFU/mL).

(2) Using a UV gel imaging system, locate the desired DNA bands (correct linearized plasmid backbone and insert fragments) and excise them with a sterile scalpel, minimizing extra gel.

(3) Purify and recover the DNA using an agarose gel extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions:

- Weigh the gel slices.
- Dissolve the gel in Binding Buffer at 65°C until the gel completely melts.
- Transfer the solution into a spin column and centrifuge.
- Wash the column twice with Wash Buffer and air dry by centrifugation.
- Elute the DNA with Elution Buffer or sterile water and collect the eluate.

(4) Measure the DNA concentration and purity with a micro-volume spectrophotometer.

Ligation Reaction

Reaction System (for a 10–20 μL total volume):

- Linearized plasmid backbone: ~50 ng (Recommended molar ratio: vector:insert = 1:3 to 1:7)
- Insert fragment DNA: X μL (adjusted to achieve the desired molar ratio)
- 10× T4 DNA Ligase Buffer: 1–2 μL
- T4 DNA Ligase: 1 μL (e.g., 5 Weiss U/μL)
- Sterile ultrapure water: Add to 10–20 μL

Protocol:

(1) Mix the reaction components gently and briefly centrifuge to collect drops.

(2) Incubate at 16°C in a water bath or metal block overnight (12–16 hours). For high-efficiency systems, incubation can be shortened to 1–2 hours.

### 3.2. Plasmid Amplification - Transformation and Culture

Chemical Transformation

(1) Take a tube of chemically competent cells (50–100 μL) from the –80°C freezer and thaw on ice for 5–10 minutes.

(2) Add 5–10 μL of the ligation product (or ~10 ng purified plasmid for a positive control, and use no DNA for a negative control) into the thawed cells. Flick the tube gently to mix without vortexing. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.

(3) Heat shock the cells at 42°C for exactly 90 seconds in a pre-heated water bath. Immediately place the tube back on ice for 2–5 minutes.

(4) Add 500–900 μL of pre-warmed antibiotic-free LB medium to the tube.

(5) Incubate the tube in a shaking incubator at 37°C and 150–200 rpm for 45–90 minutes to allow the bacteria to recover and express the antibiotic resistance gene.

Plating and Primary Screening of Positive Clones

(1) Briefly centrifuge the recovered bacterial suspension to concentrate the cells, discard part of the supernatant, and resuspend the remaining cells (~100–150 μL).

(2) Spread the resuspended cells evenly onto LB selection plates containing the appropriate antibiotic (e.g., Ampicillin, Kanamycin, or Chloramphenicol) using a sterile spreader.

(3) Allow the liquid to absorb completely, then invert the plates and incubate them at 37°C for 12–16 hours.

(4) After incubation, pick individual well-isolated colonies and inoculate them into 5 mL of LB liquid medium with the corresponding antibiotic.

(5) Grow cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm in a shaking incubator overnight (12–16 hours).

### 3.3. Plasmid Extraction and Verification

Miniprep to Extract Plasmid DNA

Use a miniprep kit to extract plasmid DNA from 1.5–5 mL of overnight bacterial culture:
