# OVERVIEW

This project focuses on the prevention and intervention of intestinal microbiota imbalance during the perioperative period\. Leveraging synthetic biology technology, we engineered Lactobacillus caseiinto an "intestinal health guardian" probiotic strain—incorporating the p16090 bile acid\-inducible promoter, OLE1 oleic acid synthesis gene, accA oleic acid expression\-enhancing gene, and DEFB4A defensin gene\. This enables precise in\-situ secretion of oleic acid within the gut to suppress pathogenic bacteria and modulate immune balance, addressing clinical pain points such as the psychological barriers of traditional fecal microbiota transplantation and the limited efficacy of conventional probiotics\.

Beyond technological development, the project establishes a multidimensional framework encompassing "education outreach – inclusive practice – sustainable development – cross\-sector collaboration – commercial translation\." This system spans knowledge dissemination from campuses to the global community, technology implementation from laboratories to clinical settings, and health empowerment for both vulnerable groups and the general public\. The ultimate goal is to narrow healthcare resource disparities, advance health equity, and deliver "Lanzhou University’s solution," "Gansu’s solution," and "China’s solution" for global perioperative intestinal health management\.

To efficiently translate the concept into practice, we structured the workflow into three synergistic phases based on synthetic biology research logic and social value realization pathways: the Preparation Phase, Exploration Phase, and Responsibility Phase\. These stages progress cumulatively and interconnect seamlessly—the Preparation Phase lays the groundwork for technical and cognitive foundations, the Exploration Phase achieves technological breakthroughs and validates practical applications, and the Responsibility Phase amplifies societal impact and value dissemination\. Together, they form a closed loop of "scientific innovation – practice feedback – iterative optimization," ensuring the project integrates scientific rigor with social practicality\.


# Preparation phase

Guided by a problem\-orientedapproach, our team employed a tripartite methodology—literature review, expert interviews, and frontline fieldwork—to define the project’s strategic direction and solidify its implementation foundation\. All guiding faculty members \(including university professors\), clinicians, industry experts, and academic scholars contributed specialized insights, offering recommendations that were deeply integrated with both the project’s strategic vision and operational details\.

Simultaneously, we established synergistic collaborations with ​hospitals, enterprises, and community stakeholders, systematically gathering empirical data and actionable improvement proposals\. These multi\-sectoral engagements provided critical support to bridge the gap between the project’s initial "laboratory concept" and its eventual "real\-world application," ensuring the foundational robustness required for subsequent phases\.

## Project Inspiration: Addressing Clinical Pain Points

The project originated from identifying critical gaps in clinical practice\. During their internship at the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, team members observed a prevalent challenge among perioperative patients: intestinal microbiota imbalance\. One patient who underwent gastrointestinal surgery developed severe microbiota dysbiosis following antibiotic treatment and fasting stress, manifesting as bloating, infections, and other complications\. This not only prolonged hospitalization but also imposed significant financial burdens on the family\.

Further investigation revealed substantial limitations in conventional solutions\. Fecal microbiota transplantation \(FMT\) required patients to overcome psychological barriers, while the standardized and uniform processing of fecal microbiota preparations remained technically challenging—constraints that hindered its broader application\.

During a group discussion, a classmate’s yogurt sparked our interest\. "Probiotics," commonly featured in yogurt and health products, are often promoted for their digestive benefits and gut\-stabilizing properties\. However, the probiotic components in food proved insufficient to resolve microbiota imbalance due to inherent limitations in their quantity and functionality\.

The emergence of synthetic biology offered a transformative solution\. By genetically engineering probiotics to possess "intestinal\-targeted responsiveness" and "multifunctional synergy", we envisioned creating a "living drug" capable of precisely modulating the gut microbiota\. Concurrently, the team recognized the unique challenges faced by northwestern China—where Lanzhou University is located—including geographic remoteness, limited economic resources, and shortages of educational and healthcare infrastructure\. These factors, coupled with low public awareness of gut health, strengthened our resolve to pursue a dual\-track approach combining technological innovationwith knowledge dissemination\.

Thus, the "Gut Health Guardian" project was conceived: an engineered probiotic strain\-based solution designed to tackle perioperative microbiota imbalance through scientific rigor and accessible health education\.

## Further Understanding

After recognizing the broad prospects of engineered probiotic strains in treating perioperative intestinal microbiota imbalance, we delved deeper into its significance and feasibility\. Our initial step was to visit the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, where we interviewed several physicians from diverse departments—including Professor Yatao Liu and Professor Jianming Tang\.

Through discussions with these clinicians, we gained a nuanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms​ driving perioperative microbiota dysbiosis and the spectrum of available treatment options\. In\-depth interviews revealed that the ​core mechanisms​ of this imbalance involve a triad of factors:

​1\.Preoperative fasting, which deprives gut microbiota of essential nutrients;

​2\.Intraoperative traumatic stress, which disrupts the mucosal barrier; and

​3\.Postoperative antibiotic use, which indiscriminately eliminates both pathogenic and commensal bacteria\.

The synergistic impact of these three elements leads to the overproliferation of harmful bacteria, ultimately destabilizing the gut ecosystem\.

Beyond physician consultations, we engaged representatives from the target patient population\. After clearly explaining our project’s core functionalities, applicable scenarios, and advantages, we patiently addressed their inquiries regarding usage methods, safety profiles, and expected outcomes\.

The feedback was unequivocally positive: the patient representative expressed clear interest in utilizing our product and a preference for its selection\. This direct response not only validates target users’ acceptance of the solution but also provides some feasibility evidence for the product’s future successful market launch\.

To incorporate the business perspective, our team interviewed Mr\. Jinghong Liu, the founder of Jinghong Health Products Co\., Ltd\., a company honored as a "China Preferred Brand\."

Mr\. Liu pointed out that medical and health products need to balance "technological excellence, scientifically \- formulated ingredients, and a brand with soul\." Technologically, it is essential to achieve breakthroughs in strain stability and mass \- production processes\. Formulation \- wise, the products should be scientific and suitable for the gut\. Regarding the brand, it is necessary to enhance user identification through stories and culture\.

He particularly emphasized the importance of intellectual property protection and multi \- team collaboration\. He suggested that the team should plan patent applications in advance and build a collaborative network of "industry \- academia \- research \- hospital" by joining forces with universities, enterprises, and hospitals\. These suggestions have provided crucial guidance for the project's commercial transformation path and brand building\.

The team also learned that the global probiotics market has been steadily growing in recent years\. According to data from MarketsandMarkets, the global probiotics market size was estimated to be $61\.1 billion in 2021\. It is expected to continue growing at a compound annual growth rate \(CAGR\) of 8\.3% from 2021 to 2026, reaching $91\.1 billion by 2026\. This market holds significant opportunities\.

# Exploration phase

After reviewing the relevant literature and conducting preliminary verification that oleic acid affects perioperative gut microbiota imbalance, we realized the necessity of clearly defining the specific application scenarios and positioning of the drug\. Against this background, we reached out to bioscience experts, Professor Zhenyou Zhou and Professor Hengliang Lang\. After introducing our ideas and uncertainties to them, both professors pointed out significant issues we face and suggested that we could leverage microorganisms to regulate the gastrointestinal tract\. They highlighted that synthetic biology has become a popular field in recent years, offering the knowledge required to engineer bacteria, thereby ensuring practicality and economic feasibility\. As a result, our team began to study and discuss synthetic biology\.

To further advance the project, we interviewed experts in the biosciences and discussed the feasibility and specific details of the project, deepening our understanding of perioperative gut microbiota imbalance\. These bioscience experts provided us with many practical and effective suggestions for the issues and uncertainties we encountered during our experimental work\. Through dialogues with them, we gained a more profound understanding of our mission and came up with new ideas for the future implementation of the project\.

As a project focused on disease treatment, continuous communication with experts and clinicians in relevant fields is crucial\. Professor Liu, Professor Zhou, Professor Tang, and Professor Lang have consistently offered us support and care, providing highly constructive advice from project design to problems encountered during experiments\.

After fully demonstrating the feasibility and market potential of the project, we contacted AMATHES, a company based in Suzhou, and submitted a detailed project plan\. The company’s executives gave high praise and strong support to our project’s development and marketing\.

We have also engaged in in\-depth discussions with outstanding students from many universities, including Tianjin University \(TJUSLS\_China\), Jilin University \(JLU\-NBBMS\), Ocean University of China \(OUC\-China\), Nankai University \(NKU\-China\), and Zhengzhou University \(ZZU\-IGEM\)\.
