# Overview

We firmly believe that the right to health should be shared by all, especially those who are disadvantaged in terms of access to knowledge, resources, and services. Adhering to our core vision of "building a world where no one suffers from lack of health," we have a presence in villages, communities, hospitals, and laboratories across Gansu. Through a series of targeted health education and forward-thinking professional practices, we are committed to systematically addressing the knowledge gap in intestinal health and promoting equitable access to infection prevention resources. This is more than just a series of activities; it is a comprehensive practice of health knowledge dissemination, public health promotion, and social inclusiveness. We aim to provide a replicable "Gansu experience" for building a healthier, more resilient, and more compassionate future society.

In this era of information explosion, we were startled to discover that fundamental knowledge about gut health remains severely lacking among the general grassroots population. According to our preliminary research, many rural residents are completely unaware of the basic functions of gut microbiota, with nearly 70% of respondents attributing intestinal infections simplistically to "eating spoiled food" while possessing minimal awareness of preventive measures. This knowledge gap is not confined to rural areas—it is equally pronounced among urban low-income groups, elderly populations, and ethnic minority communities. The widespread disparity in health literacy prompted us to launch a series of targeted health promotion initiatives.

Our practice demonstrates that effective health knowledge dissemination requires breaking away from the traditional one-way communication model and adopting new, participatory, and experiential approaches. With support from the Gansu Red Cross Society, we innovatively integrated health knowledge into interactive games and simulations, enabling participants to master health skills through practice. This innovative approach not only improves the efficiency of knowledge dissemination but, more importantly, stimulates public initiative and enthusiasm for learning health knowledge.

# Eliminating the Gap in Intestinal Health Knowledge: A Systematic Project from "Knowledge" to "Action"

## 1\. In-depth Analysis of the Problem: Information Silos and Cognitive Gaps

In the vast yet unevenly distributed northwest region, basic physiology, hygiene, and first aid remain an "information island" for many rural children. This knowledge deficit is systemic: it stems from a relative shortage of high-quality educational resources, a disconnect between popular science content and local cultural context, and the ineffectiveness of traditional didactic education. Our preliminary research uncovered an alarming phenomenon: many children can recognize popular cartoon characters but cannot name the exact location of the heart; they know that getting pricked by a needle causes pain, yet most do not understand how to properly clean a wound to prevent infection. This highlights a significant cognitive disconnect between everyday experiences and scientific knowledge.

Our core reflection: The dissemination of health knowledge must go beyond the one-way transmission of information. It must be a profound process of "translation" and "connection," translating abstract medical principles into a language accessible to children, and connecting external knowledge to their internal cognitive structures and daily behaviors. This is the underlying logic behind all our actions.

Our reflections: Health is the cornerstone of development, and inequality in medical knowledge is an unfair starting point. While urban children are already learning programming and robotics, rural children are still struggling to understand the mysteries of the body. If this gap is not addressed and addressed, it will perpetuate intergenerational inequality. We cannot wait for knowledge to flow naturally; we must proactively provide it to them, using methods that are most accessible to them.

## 2\. Our Actions: Sowing the Scientific Seeds of Life

### 2.1 "Intestinal Microcosm" Health Enlightenment Course

At Gongzhuang Primary School and other locations, we designed a fully interactive curriculum focused on the five senses. We abandoned traditional rote instruction and instead used familiar mealtimes—"Why do you think sugar is sweet? How do you smell your mother's cooking?"—to encourage children to actively explore the sources of their senses of sight, taste, hearing, smell, and touch.This experience wasn't just about imparting knowledge; it was also about developing self-awareness.

### 2.2 Popularization of First Aid Knowledge Through “Hug of Life”

With the support of the Gansu Red Cross Society, we went deep into the community to promote first aid knowledge to children and families. We realized that boring theoretical teaching has limited effect, so we innovatively adopted the "scenario simulation + task punch-in" model. Children practiced the Heimlich first aid method in a scenario simulating airway foreign body obstruction and mastered the skills of stopping bleeding by bandaging each other. Children who completed all the "tasks" will receive a special "First Aid Little Guardian" certificate and manual, which greatly stimulated their enthusiasm for learning. A mother who participated in the event told us: "Before, when the baby fell and broke, he would just cry, but now he will run to find a clean cloth to press it down first. What you teach can really save lives."

### 2.3 “Future Scientists” Laboratory Launch Plan

Our collaboration with the Lanzhou University Medical Genetics Center Laboratory represents a bold challenge to the perceived privilege of knowledge. Before entering the lab, we didn't simply read out the rules; instead, we discussed with the children the ethics of scientists: Why should we respect experimental animals? Why should we faithfully record data—even if it's a failure? The moment the children donned their lab coats and saw their own oral epithelial cells under a high-powered microscope, their awe was beyond words. Student Li Zhe wrote in his lab report, "I see my cells moving. They're living beings, just like me. I want to study how to prevent cells from getting sick." At that moment, we clearly saw the seeds of science, breaking free from the constraints of geography and resources, sprouting in a young mind. This embodies the highest value of inclusive science education.

# Promoting Equitable Access to Health Resources: Precise Drip Irrigation to Bridge the "Last Mile"

## 1\. In-depth Research: Health Concerns and Structural Dilemmas on the Plateau

Our research in Gangjia Town, Xiahe County, Gannan, at an average altitude of over 3,000 meters, revealed the complexities of primary healthcare services. Not only does this area face a shortage of emergency medical resources, but it also faces a potential crisis of chronic diseases caused by the plateau climate, a diet high in oil and salt (tsampa and butter tea), and strenuous physical labor. The incidence of hypertension, joint diseases, and digestive ailments is significantly higher than in the plains, while the mentality of "bearing minor illnesses and delaying treatment for major ones" remains prevalent. This is not simply a problem of medical resources but a structural dilemma woven together by health literacy, economic conditions, and geographical conditions.

### 1.1 “Medical Health Tour”: A free clinic integrating medicine and anthropology

In Xike Village, Ganga Township, our free clinic went beyond simple measurements and medication. We assisted a doctor in measuring the four dimensions of an elderly woman suffering from chronic back pain and discovered a significantly elevated waist-to-hip ratio. Following a thorough interview, we determined that her pain was closely linked to obesity and strain. Rather than prescribing medication, the doctor, through an interpreter, patiently drew simple diagrams for weight loss and waist protection exercises, and advised her family to adjust the amount of fat in their diet. Furthermore, the donated medications were specifically formulated for storage in the high altitude. This experience has profoundly taught us that effective health interventions in ethnic minority areas must integrate both medical diagnosis and cultural understanding.

## 2\. Precision Practice: Holistic Health Intervention from Knowledge to Behavior

### 2.1 "Health in the Community": A Science Popularization Event Integrating Medicine and Humanities

In many grassroots communities, our health education initiatives go beyond simple knowledge transfer. For a resident experiencing frequent gastrointestinal discomfort, we not only provided intestinal health information but also, through in-depth discussions, helped them analyze potential poor dietary habits and develop a plan for improvement. Rather than simply preaching, volunteers used practical language and illustrations to patiently explain the importance of maintaining a balanced gut microbiome and recommended dietary adjustments for families. Furthermore, the health brochures we distributed featured large fonts and illustrations, making them more accessible to grassroots communities. This experience has profoundly taught us that effective health interventions must integrate both professional knowledge and humanistic care.

### 2.2 "Healthy Life" Public Welfare Project

The "Healthy Living" project's continued success stems from its establishment of a sustainable health promotion model. We not only have a professional health education team, but also have established a long-term partnership with the community. At events in various regions, we saw volunteers innovating service formats.  These allowing residents to master health knowledge through interactive experiences. The health manuals and supplies distributed throughout the project ensure the continued dissemination of health knowledge. This demonstrates that inclusive health initiatives require a sustainable, virtuous cycle, not a one-off initiative.

## 3\. Empowering Women and Children with Special Needs

### 3.1 Women's Health and Career Development

During our social practice in Yichang, we focused on the career paths of female talent. Through the "University Students Visit Their Hometown" initiative, we engaged in in-depth discussions with prominent female scientists, entrepreneurs, and grassroots officials from Yichang. They shared the unique challenges and opportunities they face in their careers, such as balancing career and family, and excelling in male-dominated fields. These authentic stories provided us with valuable insights, enabling us to more precisely address the needs of female talent in our subsequent talent policy initiatives.

### 3.2 Special Love for the Special You

The highest expression of inclusivity lies in caring for the most vulnerable. We collaborated with professional special education teachers to design gentle science activities specifically for children with autism, such as using different fabrics to experience touch and creating "gentle reactions" with soothing music and colorful liquids. In another setting, we connected with and accompanied a little girl with cerebral palsy in a LEGO class. When she struggled to finally place a brick precisely on the base and a brilliant smile spread across her face, we were all deeply moved. This was a profound reminder that physical limitations cannot constrain the soaring power of wisdom; every life has its own unique way of blooming and infinite potential.

## 4\. Angel Classroom Project

We got to know Xiaoyu, a 10-year-old leukemia patient from Gansu Provincial People's Hospital, through the Gansu Provincial Red Cross. We learned in depth about her and her family's situation, and introduced to them knowledge related to gut health as well as synthetic biology. We all hope that one day synthetic biology technology can also help treat leukemia patients. Finally, we jointly created a facial makeup artwork.

# Deepening Professional Practice: An Innovative Bridge Connecting Talent Training and Social Needs

## 1\. Clinical Genetics Practice: The Transformation from a “Learner” to a “Quasi-practitioner”

Background and Challenges: Medical genetics is a rapidly developing discipline, but university education often lags behind clinical practice, resulting in graduates facing a "knowledge gap".

Our innovative practice: The several-week internship at Gansu Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital/Gansu Provincial Central Hospital was an immersive preview of our careers. Team members were no longer passive observers, but rather "quasi-practitioners" responsible for every karyotype analysis report they issued. They faced the complexity of clinical samples and, under the guidance of their instructors, learned to identify abnormal signals and experience the weight of an accurate report on a family's fate.

In-depth results: This "learning by doing" model has greatly accelerated students' transition to professional careers. Team member Wang wrote in his practical experience summary, "'Chromosome translocation' is a cold term in textbooks, but when I saw the karyotype report from a mother with recurrent miscarriages, I truly understood the significance of our work. This, more than any other class, has reassured me about my future direction."

## 2\. Nutrition Support Education: Exploring the Journey from “Cultural Sensitivity” to “Community Empowerment”

In our nutrition support program in Linxia, we implemented a community-centered approach. We first sought to respect and understand the local culinary culture, which is primarily based on pasta, beef, and mutton, through in-depth interviews and field research. Rather than rigidly promoting a Mediterranean diet, we worked with the children to design nutritionally enhanced recipes based on local ingredients—for example, increasing the proportion of vegetables in noodles and exploring healthier ways to cook lamb. When the children proudly displayed their "My Nutritional Plates," filled with local fruits, vegetables, and meats, we witnessed not only the absorption of knowledge but also the sparked creativity and confidence in their cultural identity. This empowering intervention has far more lasting and profound effects than a one-way indoctrination.

# Innovative Publicity System: Building a Multi-level Public Welfare Communication Network

Throughout the project's development, we've come to realize that effective publicity and advocacy are crucial for expanding the project's impact and mobilizing public participation. Through systematic planning and targeted communication, we've established a comprehensive publicity matrix to ensure the concept of synthetic biology projects reaches the public.

## 1\. Creative Design of Theme Poster

We collaborated with the School of Art at Lanzhou University to form a professional design team to create a series of impactful and culturally distinctive promotional posters that are not only visually striking but also emotionally resonant.

![picture_27](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5562/inclusivity/image27.webp)

## 2\. Diversified Publicity Practices

We adopted a combination of online and offline methods to carry out a series of creative publicity activities to ensure the breadth and depth of information dissemination.

### 2.1 Campus Promotion

We set up a permanent promotional area on the Lanzhou University campus, using display boards, brochures, and volunteer presentations to educate faculty and students about the project. This fall, we also launched a mobile promotional station during freshman orientation, attracting significant attention from both faculty and students.

## 3\. Construction of Publicity Material System

To ensure the professionalism and sustainability of our promotional activities, we have established a complete promotional material system:

Standardized Advocacy Toolkit:

It includes project introduction leaflets, activity process guides, volunteer manuals, etc. to ensure the accuracy and consistency of promotional content.

Development of featured promotional materials:

\- Customized material package: Let participants understand the project concept through experience

\- "Love Message" postcards: Special postcards made with children's drawings to enhance emotional connection

\- Project commemorative badge: enhance the sense of belonging of volunteers and participants

# Conclusion

From life enlightenment in rural classrooms to free health clinics deep in the grasslands; from the spark of science in the laboratory to the professional refinement on the front lines of clinical practice—we are pursuing a development path centered on inclusiveness. This requires us to possess not only compassion but also a scientific mind and the courage to innovate, systematically breaking down barriers of knowledge, resources, and culture. We firmly believe that every patient explanation strengthens the foundation of social equity; every meticulous inspection weaves a protective network for public health; and every attentive companionship builds social capital for progress and good. The road ahead is long and arduous, but we forge ahead with determination, knowing that true prosperity lies in allowing the sunshine and rain of knowledge to nourish every heart, allowing the blessings of health to transcend mountains and rivers and warm every life, and in reaching a better future together through inclusiveness and progress.
